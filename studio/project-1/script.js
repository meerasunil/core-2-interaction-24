    '1.1': 'By this art you may contemplate the variations of the 23 letters...',
    '1.2': 'The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV',
    '2.1': 'The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings.',
    '2.2': 'From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors.',
    '2.3': 'The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase.',
    '2.4': 'One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest.',
    '2.5': 'To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets.',
    '2.6': 'In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy ones fecal necessities.',
    '2.7': 'Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances.',
    '2.8': 'In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances.',
    '2.9': 'Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon.',
    '2.10':' The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.',
    '3.1': 'Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born.',
    '3.2': 'Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite.',
    '3.3': 'I say that the Library is unending.',
    '3.4': 'The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space.',
    '3.5': 'They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable.',
    '3.6': '(The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.)',
    '3.7': 'Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum:',
    '3.8': 'The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.',
    '4.1': 'There are five shelves for each of the hexagons walls;',
    '4.2': 'each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format;',
    '4.3': 'each book is of four hundred and ten pages;',
    '4.4': 'each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. ',
    '4.5': 'There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say.',
    '4.6':'I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious.',
    '4.7': ' Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.',
    '5.1': 'First: The Library exists ab aeterno.',
    '5.2': 'This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind.',
    '5.3': 'Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi;',
    '5.4': ' the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. ',
    '5.5':'To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: ',
    '5.6':'punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.',
    '6.1': 'Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.^',
    '6.2': 'This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. ',
    '6.3': 'One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last.',
    '6.4': ' Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. ',
    '6.5': 'This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. ',
    '6.6':'(I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of ones palm...',
    '6.7':'They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)',
