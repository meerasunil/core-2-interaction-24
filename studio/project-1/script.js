    '1.1': 'By this art you may contemplate the variations of the 23 letters...',
    '1.2': 'The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV',
    '2.1': 'The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings.',
    '2.2': 'From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors.',
    '2.3': 'The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase.',
    '2.4': 'One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest.',
    '2.5': 'To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets.',
    '2.6': 'In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy ones fecal necessities.',
    '2.7': 'Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances.',
    '2.8': 'In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances.',
    '2.9': 'Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon.',
    '2.10':' The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.',
    '3.1': 'Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born.',
    '3.2': 'Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite.',
    '3.3': 'I say that the Library is unending.',
    '3.4': 'The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space.',
    '3.5': 'They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable.',
    '3.6': '(The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.)',
    '3.7': 'Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum:',
    '3.8': 'The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.',
    '4.1': 'There are five shelves for each of the hexagon\'s walls;',
    '4.2': 'each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format;',
    '4.3': 'each book is of four hundred and ten pages;',
    '4.4': 'each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. ',
    '4.5': 'There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say.',
    '4.6':'I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious.',
    '4.7': ' Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.',
    '5.1': 'First: The Library exists ab aeterno.',
    '5.2': 'This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind.',
    '5.3': 'Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi;',
    '5.4': ' the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. ',
    '5.5':'To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: ',
    '5.6':'punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.',
    '6.1': 'Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.^',
    '6.2': 'This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. ',
    '6.3': 'One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last.',
    '6.4': ' Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. ',
    '6.5': 'This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. ',
    '6.6':'(I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one\'s palm...',
    '6.7':'They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)',
    '7.1': 'For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages.',
    '7.2': ' It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak;',
    '7.3': ' it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible.',
    '7.4': ' All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV\'s cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be.',
    '7.5': ' Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail.',
    '7.6':' Others thought of cryptographs;',
    '7.7':' generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.',
    '8.1': 'Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines.',
    '8.2': 'He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese;',
    '8.3': 'others said they were Yiddish.',
    '8.4': 'Within a century, the language was established:',
    '8.5': 'a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections.',
    '8.6': 'The content was also deciphered:',
    '8.7': 'some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition.',
    '8.8': 'These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library.',
    '8.9': 'This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements:',
    '8.10':'the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet.',
    '8.11':' He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed:',
    '8.12':'In the vast Library there are no two identical books.',
    '8.13':'From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite):',
    '8.14':'Everything:',
    '8.15':'the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels\' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.',
    '9.1': 'When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness.',
    '9.2': 'All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure.',
    '9.3': 'There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon.',
    '9.4': ' The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope.',
    '9.5': ' At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications:',
    '9.6': 'books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future.',
    '9.7': 'Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication.',
    '9.8': 'These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions.',
    '9.9': 'Others went mad...',
    '9.10':' The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man\'s finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.',
    '10.1': 'At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity\'s basic mysteries -',
    '10.2': 'the origin of the Library and of time -',
    '10.3': ' might be found',
    '10.4': ' It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in words:',
    '10.5': ' if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars.',
    '10.6': 'For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons... ',
    '10.7': '. There are official searchers, inquisitors.',
    '10.8': ' I have seen them in the performance of their function:',
    '10.9': ': they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys;',
    '10.10':'they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them;',
    '10.11':' they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs;',
    '10.12':' sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words.',
    '10.13':' Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.',
    '11.1': 'As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression.',
    '11.2': ' The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable.',
    '11.3': 'A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books.',
    '11.4': 'The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders.',
    '11.5': 'The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.',
    '12.1': 'Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works.',
    '12.2': 'They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves:',
    '12.3': 'their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books.',
    '12.4': ' Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts.',
    '12.5': ' One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal.',
    '12.6': 'The other:',
    '12.7': 'every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but ',
    '12.8': ' (since the Library is total)',
    '12.9': ') there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: ',
    '12.10':'works which differ only in a letter or a comma.',
    '12.11':' Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the \' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. ',
    '12.12':'They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon:',
    '12.13':'books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical. ',
    '13.1': 'We also know of another superstition of that time:',
    '13.2': 'that of the Man of the Book.',
    '13.3': '',
    '13.4': '',
    '13.5': '',
    '13.6': '',
    '13.7': 'How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him?',
    '13.8': 'Someone proposed a regressive method:',
    '13.9': 'To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A\'s position;',
    '13.10': 'to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity...',
    '13.11': 'In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years.',
    '13.12': 'It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe 3 ; ',

    '13.22': '',

    '13.24': 'These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library.',

    '17.3': 'Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd.',
